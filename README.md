# :snake: Monty Interpreter

Welcome to the Monty Bytecode Interpreter. This interpreter was built in the C language and is compliant with `ISO90`, `ISO99`, & `ISO11`. It reads Monty bytecode files of any extension (preferably `.m` although it doesn't matter), and interprets the opcodes contained.

Our interpreter can be run as either a stack (LIFO) or queue (FIFO). Mode can be switched mid-script. The interpreter can handle a variety of Monty opcodes, including printing, mathematical operations, and more - all handled opcodes are listed below.

## :running: Getting Started

* [Ubuntu 14.04 LTS](http://releases.ubuntu.com/14.04/) - Operating system reqd.

* [GCC 4.8.4](https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-4.8/) - Compiler used


## :warning: Prerequisites

* Must have `git` installed.

* Must have repository cloned.

```
$ sudo apt-get install git
```


## :arrow_down: Installing and Using

Clone the repository into a new directory:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/BennettDixon/monty.git
```
Compile with the following:

```

```

Run the interpreter on a file:

```
